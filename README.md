# AnsarWebsitePlugins
Plugins for the new WordPress site for Ansare.

## Simple Upcoming Events

This plugin lets editors create a small list of upcoming events. Each event
supports an optional link that can point to an external URL **or** to any page
on the site. Links open in a new tab when rendered via the `[upcoming_events]`
shortcode.

## Interactive US Map

This plugin provides a shortcode `[interactive_us_map]` that displays a Google map of the contiguous United States. Cities configured in the plugin settings page appear as animated pins on the map. Each pin links to an internal page chosen by the administrator.

In the WordPress admin area, navigate to **Interactive US Map** to:

- Enter your Google Maps API key.
- Add new cities with latitude, longitude and a page link.
- Remove existing cities.

When rendered, hovering a pin causes it to glow. Clicking a pin opens the page associated with that city in a new tab.
